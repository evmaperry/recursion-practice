# Recursion Prompts
- This is a repository of prompts to be solved using recursion inside of `src/recursion.js`
- Please refrain from sharing solutions
- Try to solve prompts first using pseudocode
- This repo requires that the overall function itself is called recursively and pays no attention to subroutines called recursively.
- Feel free to make pull requests regarding bugs or suggestions
- Fork it.  You know you want to.
